## Article: [Why The Y2K Problem Still Persists In Software Development](https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2022/01/11/why-the-y2k-problem-still-persists-in-software-development/?sh=1ab14d27ff7d)

The article highlights a problem prevalent on a considerable number of e-commerce sites where years are stored in non-complete form as 2 digits, which can lead to a repeat of the notorious [Y2K problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Year_2000_problem) that took considerable industry-wide efforts to rectify and avoid a large-scale disaster. While this is not yet an immediate issue considering that it is still early in the 21st century, as we approach the 22nd century, it would become increasingly important to address this problem in order to avoid confusions, e.g. distinguishing 1980 and 2080. Instead of delegating this responsibility to future generations, the article implores software developvers to be conscious of their UX design decisions today to avoid the problem altogether later. I find this article interesting as it brings up an issue that, due to its not-so-obvious potential repercussions, is not typically prioritized in software development.

I thought this was interesting because we don't really think about what will happen that far into the future when the next '22 happens. Before it was not too big a deal because there was comparatively so little data. But now, there is so much 2022 data that 2122 would bring problems.
